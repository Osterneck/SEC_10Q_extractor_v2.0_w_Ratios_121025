hi, this is version_9.0 of my jn ipynb code which: allows you (the user,) to parse-&-extract: BalanceSheet, IncomeStatement, CF-Statement, and, have that data automatically converted to 21 financial, liquidity, and accounting ratios, from any SEC-EDGAR quarterly 10q filing, AND have the data instantly converted to visualizations, AND with all data & visualizations then downloaded to your local-machine in an xlsx and pdf... no more searching through pages manually, and, all financial-data on your desktop in 15 seconds. enjoy.
