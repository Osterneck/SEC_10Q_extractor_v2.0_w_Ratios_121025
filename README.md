hi, this is version_9.0 of my jn ipynb code which: allows you (the user,) to parse-&-extract: BalanceSheet, IncomeStatement, CF-Statement, and, convert to 21 financial, liquidity, and accounting ratios, from any SEC-EDGAR quarterly 10q filing, AND converted to visualizations, AND downloaded to your local-machine as xlsx & pdf... no more searching through pages manually, all data on your desktop in 15 seconds. enjoy.........BUT.....as of 12/23/25 we added v9.2 which is 100% Google-Python-Style-Guide compliant -- same great program, same great features, just now it's more readable and understandable for open-source access scaling.
