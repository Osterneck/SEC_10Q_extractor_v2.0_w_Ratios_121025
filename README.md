hi, this is version_9.0 of my jn ipynb code which: allows you (the user,) to parse-&-extract: BalanceSheet, IncomeStatement, CF-Statement, and, convert to 21 financial, liquidity, and accounting ratios, from any SEC-EDGAR quarterly 10q filing, AND convert to visualizations, AND download to your local-machine as xlsx & pdf... no more searching 10q pages manually, all data on your desktop in 15 secs. enjoy.........BUT.....

***as of 12/23/25*** we added v9.2 which is 100% Google-Python-Style-Guide compliant -- same great program, same great features, but now much more readable: 100% annotation and commented out, all udf's / loops / logic explained.
